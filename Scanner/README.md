In this Folder "Scanner" you will find the code to calculate the 4 corner points of a document, a perspective transformation to get a top-view of a document and the digital for the same document.
The libraries needed for this project is numpy, matplote, imutils, and OpenCV. These libraries can be installed using a pip command from Jupyter Notebook.

Scanner can be completed by following 3 steps. The first step is to find the 4 corner points of the image which can be achieved by using a contour function from OpenCV library. The second step is to find the prespection of the image which can be achieved by using get-perspection function from OpenCV library. The third step is to get top-down view of the image and transforming it to digital form using wrap function and color convertion from OpenCV library.
